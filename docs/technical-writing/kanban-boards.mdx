# 🛹 Kanban Boards

A **kanban board** is a great way to organize your tasks and projects.

Kanban boards help organize your work and keep track of what you need to do, and it can be helpful to share a kanban board with your team so everyone understands what everyone else is working on and can potentially collaborate or help each other out.

> There's a project management approach called **Agile** that can often be used in conjunction with kanban boards.

## 🎈 Kanban Board Example

Here's an example of a Kanban board that keeps track of a team's tasks using Notion:

import ThemedImage from "@theme/ThemedImage";
import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

<ThemedImage
  alt="Kanban board example"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/technical-writing/kanban-boards/kanban-example-light.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/technical-writing/kanban-boards/kanban-example-dark.png"
    ),
  }}
/>

## 🏗 Kanban Board Structure

### 📊 Columns

A kanban board is comprised of **columns** that represent the status of a card. For example, a common kanban board has columns for `Not Started`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.

### 💳 Cards

Within each column are cards that represent a task or project. These cards can be moved across columns to represent their status.

You may assign a card to a team member and set a due date, a priority, the estimated amount of effort to complete the task, and more. Some tools allow you to write notes in your cards, which can help organize your research and also get others up to speed on what you're working on.

#### 🧩 Card Template

Here's a Markdown template you can use for your kanban cards:

```markdown
## 🗺 Overview

- [ ]
